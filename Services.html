      <h2>The Amani Home</h2>
      <p>
        The mission of the Amani Home is to keep orphaned and vulnerable children in the community where they grew up, which preserves a child’s network of support. Children can continue to attend their local school and maintain close relationships with extended families while housing, food, education funding and training are provided by the Amani Home family.
      </p>

      <p>
        Community members contribute to aspects of the Amani Home so that local endorsement and sustainability is assured. The home is committed to wise use of environmental resources and is designed to be self-sustaining through a network of cottage industries
      </p>

      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>
        The full-time residents of Kithoka Amani Children’s Home (KACH) attend an academically strong, local primary school. We encourage and expect academic excellence. If you come visit, you will see all the kids huddled around a very long table after dinner each night doing their homework. The children all earn grades in the A-B range, and the strong rankings in the district set our children apart.

        We understand that to truly break the cycle of poverty, higher education is needed. Once the children reach secondary school age, most are accepted into boarding schools, which are located far from KACH. However, these schools provide a gateway to a university education. The kids always return for holidays and summer breaks.

        Karambu has kept her initial promise to dying mothers like Gladys – and others – to make every effort to provide a quality education to these children.

        Our grounds serve as a gathering place for leadership training and empowerment programs for members of the community. These programs provide the children a very communal environment where something important is occurring each week and they interact with other young people and elders and continually learn from them.

        IPI College Scholars Program (ICSP)
      </h2>
      <p>
        Among the poor in Kenya, income and quality of life aren’t much better for those who complete high school compared to those who don’t. To overcome poverty, further education is needed after high school in order to obtain vocational skills or professional credentials.

        The IPI College Scholars Program (ICSP) supports promising candidates in attaining post-secondary vocational training and bachelors degrees. We pay school fees and living expenses, when needed, that enable individuals and families to break the cycle of poverty.

        Since ICSP was founded in 2006, the program has supported more than 30 students in obtaining their undergraduate degrees in teaching, medicine, and business. Several students have gone on to self-fund master’s degrees and doctorate degrees. ICSP has raised over $100,000, all in private donations.
